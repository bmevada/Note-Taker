# Note-Taker
Week 11: Express.js Challenge

## Note-Taker Application
An application called Note Taker has been created to allow the user to write, save and delete notes.

The application uses an Express.js back end and will save, retrieve and remove note data from a JSON file.

The application’s front end was already created. The back end of the application was built and connected to the front end, and deployed the entire application to Heroku.
